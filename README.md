# CogniChain
CogniChain combines "Cognition" (the mental action of acquiring knowledge) and "Chain" (representing the linked nature of the research process). This name encapsulates the essence of my project, which is an somewhat intelligent system that chains together related topics for comprehensive analogy and connection creation.
